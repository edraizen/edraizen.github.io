  Hi, I am a PhD Student at the University of Virginia in the labs of Phil Bourne and Cameron Mura, also known as the <a href="http://bournelab.org/">Boura Lab</a>.
  I am interested in structural bioinformatics and machine learning applied to protein evolution and host-pathogen interactions.
  I am also an organizer for the <a href="https://iscb-dc-rsg.github.io/">ISCB Region Student Group in DC</a> as well help organize the Student Council Symposiums at the main ISCB conference.

  You can download my full CV <a href="DraizenCV.pdf">here<a>.
