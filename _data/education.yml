    Under the guidance of Phil Bourne and Cameron Mura, I am applying 3D Convolutional Neural Networks to
    predict protein-protein interactions (PPI) using protein structure information. This work will be used to identify
    drug binding sites to disrupt PPI and proteins involved in host-pathogen PPI. This work is also done in collaboration with
    Anna Panchenko and Alex Goncearenco at the NCBI.
    
    I am also working on developing deep learning methods such as Variational Autoencoders for protein structure classification. 
    We hope to use this to find new relationsips between CATH homologous superfamilies.
